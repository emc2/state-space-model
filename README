Modeling and proofs about the state space construction in Coq.

This is an attempt to formalize a construction that expands on Hilbert
spaces by adding an operator that, in conjunction with sums, describes
dual nondeterminism.

I also may attempt to formalize Hilbert spaces.

Note: I am relatively unfamiliar with Coq or its libraries.  This
probably shows in my work
